# **What does an Open Data Workshop look like?**

The amount of data is rising all the time, and with it its importance in our society. Large data sets are used in various research fields and businesses, and there are many places online where you can get access to data for free. One of these places is CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, which has almost 10,000 datasets from the CMS experiment freely available in its open data portal. We held a workshop about how teachers could use real data in their classes as a part of CERN’s International High School Teacher Programme, where over 40 teachers got to learn about the possibilities of teaching based on open data.

The goal of the workshop was to show teachers just how easy it can be to incorporate real data in their exercises, and why it is important. First I held a presentation about the topic, and after that the teachers got their hands dirty with practicing the use of Jupyter Notebooks. Following this we went through a more advanced example about the discovery of the Higgs boson. All in all, the workshop lasted for two hours.

### What is this about?

Why is open data useful in teaching? First, it provides students with an authentic, tangible way to interact with the way science is done. Second, it teaches students skills such as programming, data analysis and informative communication, which makes them well prepared to tackle challenges in the real world. Lastly, working with open data can teach students how to assess the credibility of information and to develop their epistemic agency.

We used the Jupyter notebook as the platform for research-based exercises. The Jupyter notebook is an amazing tool for teaching: you can combine text, code, images and animations in the same file called 'notebook'. This way everything from instructions to exercises are in the same place. Additionally, students don't have to install anything to their computers, since notebooks can be opened and edited in the browser. This saves a lot of time and effort, and more time can be spent doing the actual exercises.

### The workshop

In the workshop we went through the basics of the Jupyter notebook: how to open it on your browser, adding and editing cells, importing Python libraries, importing data and analyzing it, and plotting figures. It was challenging to find the optimal level of difficulty, as there are big differences in the programming and IT skills of the teachers. Of course, two hours is not much if you haven't coded but want to learn about how to use open data in teaching. The purpose of the workshop was not to teach programming; rather, it was to help teachers realize the possibilities that research-based exercises can bring to their classes. In the workshop our examples were from particle physics, but there are opportunities outside physics as well. Open data is just as applicable to other subjects, such as biology, economics, geography, and others.

### Authentic learning

After the exercise we went together through an advanced example. Using data from the CMS experiment we showed the process through which Higgs boson was found. According to the Standard Model, the Higgs boson can decay into two Z-bosons, which in turn decay into four leptons, such as muons and electrons. Using the energies and momenta of the decay products, we can infer the mass of the original particle. This concept is known as invariant mass, and it can be used to discover new particles such as the Higgs boson. This can be done by first simulating different known processes for the production of four leptons. When plotted in the same figure with the experimental results, we can see that the experimental values and the simulated values line up together well, if we assume a Higgs boson with a mass around 125 GeV.

The purpose of the advanced example wasn't to get the teachers to understand all the details of the discovery of the Higgs boson or how to program well. Rather, the idea was to provide a real world example of the scientific method. This mindset is important to transfer to students - in our approach, programming is a tool for making science and building things, not an end goal. And rather than focusing on the peculiarities of particle physics, the focus is in understanding the effort that goes into scientific discovery. 

Two hours is a short time to introduce people to open data, and the teachers had to process a lot of new information depending on their familiarity with the subject. However, the feedback was positive, and many teachers were excited to learn more.
