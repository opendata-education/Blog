# Welcome to our blog!

We are happy that you decided to pop in here!

We write about topics related to open data and using it as a part of high school level teaching. While it might be interesting to read about our thoughs and experiences on the field, in here you can take a peek to the teacher courses, workshops, and high school visits, we have organized. 

We hope that this blog can work as a place where you can get to know the topic without any pressure – to find information and inspiration of how we could utilize open data in high school teaching and see an example of what that process could look like. Maybe this will even spark up some conversation and interest about the topic.

Unfortunately we cannot have a comment box, so if you want to contact us – either to have a conversation about the topic or if you are interested in a possible collaboration, please do contact us by email. We appreciate all messages.
